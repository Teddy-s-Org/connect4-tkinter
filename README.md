# Connect 4 (Python)

![Game Screenshot](7x6_board.png)

I saw this video online and wanted to create the simple, pretty UI with my own contribution. Not sure whose application he is running, but I am to lazy to look. I also made a CLI version of the game before created the pretty version to explore the main 'win checking' algorithm. Overall a fun project.

-Update: Didn't realize it was supposed to be a 7x6 board. It is now updated, but this is easily changable. Thank goodness for global variables.

## Running the game (easy):
In order to run the application, it is straight-forward. Just make sure you have Python, and also make sure you have the 'tkinter' library. 

### Run the GUI version:
```
python3 connect4_gui.py
```

### Run the CLI version:
```
python3 connect4_cli.py
```

Here is the demonstrated 7x7 board:
