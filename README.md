# Connect 4 (Python)

I saw this video online and wanted to create the simple, pretty UI with my own contribution. Not sure whose application he is running, but I am to lazy to look. I also made a CLI version of the game before created the pretty version to explore the main 'win checking' algorithm. Overall a fun project.
